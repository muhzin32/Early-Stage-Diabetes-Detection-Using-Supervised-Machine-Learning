# Early-Stage Diabetes Detection Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the detection of early-stage diabetes using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features using machine learning algorithms. The project uses data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification techniques to build a predictive model.

## Project Description
The project leverages popular supervised learning algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression, to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical history and other relevant factors.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
2. **Model Selection**: Training models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using grid search to optimize model performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset for early-stage diabetes detection, containing multiple health-related features. The primary features include:
- Age
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Insulin levels
- Pedigree function
- Outcome (diabetic or non-diabetic)

Dataset Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes+Database)

### Data Format:
- The dataset consists of a CSV file with columns representing the various health features and a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
